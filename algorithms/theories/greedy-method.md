# Greedy Method

Greedy Method is an algorithm design technique that build a solution in a step by step manner by making locally optimized choices at each step with the goal of finding a globally optimized solution.

Most Greedy problems have n inputs, some constraint and an objective function. The goal is to find a subset of inputs that satisfies the constraint and max/minimizes the objective function.

## Some Common Terminology

- `Feasible Solution:` Any subset of the input that satisfies the constraint.
- `Optimal Solution:` A feasible solution that has the min/maximum objective function value.

## Problems and Alogrithms

- Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Prim's MST Algorithm
- Kruskal's MST Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
