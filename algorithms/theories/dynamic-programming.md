# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is an algorithm design method that can be used when the solution can be viewed as a sequence of decisions. It breaks the problem down to a series of **overlapping** sub-problems and builds up solutions to longer and longer sub-problems. At the end, it chooses the most optimal solution sequence as the final result.

## Optimization

DP often drastically reduces the amount of enumeration by avoiding sequences that cannot possibly be optimal using the principle of optimality.
