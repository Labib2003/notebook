# Binary Tree Traversal

Traversing a tree means visiting every node of the tree.

There are 3 ways to traverse a binary tree:

- In-order
- Pre-order
- Post-order

Consider this tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

## In-order traversal (left, root, right)

4, 2, 5, 1, 3

## Pre-order traversal (root, left, right)

1, 2, 4, 5, 3

## Post-order traversal (left, right, root)

4, 5, 2, 3, 1
